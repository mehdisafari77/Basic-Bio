# Basic-Bio

I created a portfolio for my professional work in order to showcase my skills, who I am, what I do and also include sections to showcase the work in terms of visuals and also links that gives access to my repositories. Also, I have included a contact form for people to be able to contact me, and also social media links to allow following abilities. This website is made to be responsive.

## Technologies Used
- HTML - used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS - styles html elements on page
- Git - version control system to track changes to source code
- Javascript - just minor javascript for text animation.

## Summary 
A website with 8 sections. A navigation, home, about, portfolio, projects, skills, contact me, and a footer section. The website includes links internally and externally to outside sources such as repos, social media. The website is done with only 1% Javascript and is mainly done in pure HTML and CSS.
